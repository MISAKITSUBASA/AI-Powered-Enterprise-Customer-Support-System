## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Conversational Support

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages OpenAI's language models to comprehend user queries in natural language
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Retrieves relevant information from company documents
- **Multi-Language Support**: Can process and respond in multiple languages
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for each response

### 2. Emotion Analysis

- **Sentiment Detection**: Analyzes the emotional tone of user messages
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusts AI response style based on detected emotions
- **Emotion Categories**: Recognizes multiple emotional states (angry, sad, anxious, confused, urgent, positive, neutral)
- **Visual Indicators**: Displays emotion detection to users for transparency
- **Escalation Triggers**: Uses emotional state as a factor in escalation decisions

### 3. Knowledge Management

- **Document Upload**: Supports multiple document formats
- **Automated Processing**: Converts documents to searchable vector embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant content based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Relevance Scoring**: Ranks knowledge base results by relevance to the query
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing information in the knowledge base

### 4. Intelligent Escalation

- **Confidence-Based Escalation**: Automatically escalates low-confidence issues
- **Emotion-Triggered Escalation**: Escalates based on detected user frustration
- **Manual Escalation**: Allows users to request human support at any time
- **Escalation Routing**: Directs issues to appropriate human agents
- **Escalation Analytics**: Tracks escalation patterns to improve system performance

### 5. Admin Dashboard

- **System Analytics**: Provides insights into system usage and performance
- **Cost Tracking**: Estimates API usage costs and provides optimization suggestions
- **User Management**: Allows administrators to manage user accounts
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Interface for document upload and management
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays key metrics like response time, accuracy, and escalation rate

### 6. Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for users and administrators
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks system activity for security monitoring
